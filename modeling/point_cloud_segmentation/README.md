# PointNetSeg - Point Cloud Segmentation

This repository implements the PointNet-based segmentation model (PointNetSeg) for point cloud data. The model is designed to classify each point in a point cloud into a predefined set of classes, leveraging a combination of feature and spatial transformations.

### Model Overview

#### T-Net

The T-Net module is used for both input and feature transformation. It helps align the point cloud in a canonical space by predicting affine transformations.

#### Transform Module

The Transform module includes the T-Net for both the input and feature space. This module is crucial for applying spatial transformations to the point cloud data before extracting features.

#### PointNetSeg

The PointNetSeg model processes the transformed features to perform point-wise segmentation. The modelâ€™s final layer predicts the class of each point.

- Input: Point cloud of shape (batch_size, num_points, 3), where each point has 3 coordinates (x, y, z).
- Output: Class scores for each point in the point cloud, with a shape of (batch_size, num_classes, num_points).

#### Dataset

Point cloud data and corresponding segmentation labels are loaded using a custom Dataset class. The dataset is stored in .pts files (for point clouds) and .seg files (for labels).

Each point cloud is normalized and augmented with random rotations and noise. The point clouds are sampled to 2000 points.

#### Data Processing Functions

- cent_norm: Centers and normalizes the point cloud.
- rotation_z: Rotates the point cloud around the z-axis.
- add_noise: Adds random Gaussian noise to the points.
- sample_2000: Randomly samples 2000 points from the point cloud for training.

#### Training

The model is trained using a standard cross-entropy loss (NLLLoss), with optional regularization to penalize transformations that deviate from identity matrices (using Frobenius norm). The training script supports validation, model saving, and batch-wise training with data augmentation.

#### Key Components:

- Input Transformation: The input transformation network aligns the input point cloud in a canonical space.
- Feature Transformation: The feature transformation network aligns the feature space for point-wise predictions.
- Loss Function: The loss function includes classification loss and regularization based on transformation matrices.
